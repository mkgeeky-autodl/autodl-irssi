# autodl-irssi

[autodl-irssi](https://github.com/mkgeeky-autodl/autodl-irssi) is a plugin for [irssi](https://irssi.org/) that monitors IRC announce channels and downloads torrent files based on user-defined filters.


## First of all

* I'm not the creator of this plugin. I have forked it, since thebigmunch stopped support and updates in 2020.
* I can't update the main code, because i'm not a perl coder. If you need help with the base code, try google.

## Getting Started

* Read the [docs](https://autodl-community.github.io/autodl-irssi).
